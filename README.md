# M897520  Non-Relativistic Quantum Mechanics

## Announcement


## Resources

We will be loosely following the order of topics in
* [C-T] *Quantum Mechanics*, Claude Cohen-Tannoudji, Bernard Diu, and Franck Laloë, Volumes 1 and 2 (1977),

but the details may differ from those in the books.

Other recommended references are
* [Bal] *Quantum Mechanics: A Modern Development*, Leslie E. Ballentine (1998),
* [SN] *Modern Quantum Mechanics*, 3rd ed., J.J. Sakurai and Jim Napolitano (2020),
* [SW] *Quantum Processes, Systems, & Information*, Benjamin Schumacher and Michael Westmoreland (2010),
* [Mer] *Quantum Mechanics*, 3rd ed., Eugen Merzbacher (1997) [WKB approximation].
<!--
For the topic on hidden variables and Bell nonlocality, I recommend
* [Per] *Quantum Theory: Concepts and Methods*, Asher Peres (1993).-->
